<H1 style='color:yellow'>The Inhabitent Website - Project 4</H1>

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Brief Description:</H2>

This is a website that sells camping gear. The purpose of the project is to develop the website, using WordPress. Given that WP is written in PHP, we will be using PHP to create a custom wordpress theme.

The requirement calls for a desktop-only design. More specifically, a fixed-width of 1120px.

<H2 style='color:yellow'>Personal Learnings:</H2>

- Of course, learning how to use the above technologies and development tools, is obvious.
- Overall, I found WordPress pretty easy to install, setup, and use.
- It was a bit challenging to understand how the WP menu item tied into the templates, which in turn, tied into the styling files. But i got it, eventually.
- If I had to do this project over, from scratch, I would: - Spend A LOT more time, reviewing the comps, to see how the pages differed and how they were the same. - I would spend A LOT more time - in reviewing the comps -- what styling blocks that I could reuse. For example, there are only 2-3 different buttons. Those could be setup in \_buttons.scss file, and then called with slightly different implementation. - Bottom Line: Spend more time planning, and let time coding. Re-use as much code as possible.
  I'll try my best to apply the above learnings to our next project and our community project.

  - Archive template for the adventures post type
  - Single template for individual adventues
  - Taxonomy template for adventures
